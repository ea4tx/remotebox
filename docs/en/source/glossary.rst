   GND
       Ground

   PCB
       Printed Circuit Board

   PWM
       Pulse-width Modulation. Used on some models to allow rotator speed control

   Yaesu GS232A
       Interface for rotor control (designed by Yaesu for some of its rotators) and its :term:`API` or control commands have been universally adopted by other interface manufacturers.
       This is the example of the ARS-USB that, instead of defining its own interface, has chosen to incorporate those commands, making it 100% compatible with the programs that support the GS232A.
