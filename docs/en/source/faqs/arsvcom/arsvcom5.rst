Integration with Other Programs
===============================

Once the ARS-USB is connected to the computer, Windows creates and assigns a serial port through which any program can communicate.

.. Note:: 
    Remember that the ARS-USB is compatible with the Yaesu GS232A interface, and communication through that serial port must use the GS232A protocol.
    However, if you use ARSVCOM, that serial port is occupied by ARSVCOM, but you can create a virtual port through ARSVCOM that can be used by other programs.

----------

And through that virtual port created by ARSVCOM, other programs can communicate. Additionally, ARSVCOM is capable of emulating other protocols besides GS232A.
