Offsets
=========

The ARS-USB functions as a voltmeter, meaning that if a motor rotates 360ยบ and the potentiometer is powered at 5V, it's normal and predictable for the voltage reading to be 2.5V at the halfway point (180ยบ).

However, in some motor models, this is not the case, causing the ARS-USB calculations to be incorrect.

Due to this, the ARS-USB software has the option to apply corrections to correct this issue. We can use an option called **Offset** for this purpose.
