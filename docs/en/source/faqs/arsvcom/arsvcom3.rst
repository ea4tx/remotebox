Calibration
=========

For the proper functioning of the ARS-USB, it is essential to perform a correct calibration.
Remember that the ARS-USB essentially acts as a voltmeter, and calibration will allow it to transform the voltage it reads into degrees.
The motors we will be working with use a potentiometer that rotates as the motor rotates. If that potentiometer is powered, for example, at 5V, it will provide between 0V for the left limit and 5V for the right.

Therefore, the ARS-USB will read that voltage and, thanks to proper calibration, will be able to calculate the motor's position in degrees.
